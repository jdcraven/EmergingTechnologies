                                In a previous class, Advanced Open Source web development, we had briefly touched on using the MEAN development method using
                                Mongo DB as the database and using Express JS and Node JS for the server using the Angular JS to handle the front end.  We were only
                                able to briefly touch on using Angular JS and I would like to further my knowledge using all these tools especially Angular JS for at my
                                work we have been starting to implement Angular into our projects, however in a Microsoft .Net environment at work with an sql server DB.  
                                I hope to learn more about making the website secure and publicly accessible and security/managing Mongo DB also learning more about Angular JS.  
                                I would like to build an application that will allow user to login to the site using their Facebook accounts and be able to track their exercise.  
                                Users will be able to track their progress of several excercises for example running, pushups, sit ups, or weights lifting exercises and the reps and weights that they did.

                                <li>Track different exercise regiments and track weight loss/gains</li>

                            <h4>Week One - Sunday, Jan 8</h4>
                            This week I research/decided what I was going to research and what type of project that I was going 
                            to be be creating.(2 hours) I decided to continue learning the Open source tools that were introduced to in our Advanced open
                            source web development class using MEAN development.  I did some research and found resources for developers to use Facebook as a secure login for a website.  Using
                            Facebook as a login to your site has proven track of increasing traffic and usage of applications.(1 hour)  Through work I also have access to plural site 
                            and have started finding resources for angular development.(1 hour)
                            <hr />
                            <h4>Week Two - Sunday, Jan 15</h4>
                            Having a registered late to this class due to complications with creating my schedule for the rest of my program I am working this week on setting up
                            the site in which I will present my research on using the http://ict.neit.edu/ server to host the site.  (2 hours)  I have also started Code Academy and
                            plural site tutorials on using Angular JS. (6 hours)  I have also started the creation of my site on my application. Node has been fully installed on my machine not just 
                            the portable version and the main structure for the application has been set up.(2 hours)  Next week I will be setting up my github repository for my application.
                            I will also be enhancing the web site where my research is being presented adding bootstrap and other styling to the page.  I will also start setting up the layout for 
                            my application and review/research what I will need to implement to my app.
                            <hr />
                            <h4>Week Three - Sunday, Jan 23</h4>
                            This week I worked on building my application and started to set up mongodb (about 5 hours). I also did some more plural sight training on Angular JS (about 3 hours).  
                            I also started to do more research on using a facebook login (1 hour).  No real road blocks right now.  In this week and the coming weeks I will need to do some reading on 
                            MEAN development from a book call getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node.  I will need to research having the site publicly accessible and what other configurations 
                            I will need to implement into Node.  Much of next week will be dedicated to research on how I want to design this application and what it will take to achieve it.
                            <hr />
                            <h4>Week Four - Sunday, Jan 30 </h4>
                            This week I learned another approach that we use at my work on a .Net envioronment.  While I likely will not use this in my project it was interesting to learn another open source 
                            library of javascript code using Jquery and knockout to control the UI. I learned about knockout js that uses the mvvm approach that works similar to angular in ways with data binding 
                            using observables. I did a tutorial on knockout by john papa on essentials of coding with knockout JavaScript. (4 hours)I have become a fan of john papas approach and teaching style for 
                            learning JavaScript and proper techniques to use in practice. I also started to review and read chapters in my book on MEAN development(5 hours). I still have more research to do about 
                            creating secure logins that I hope to learn in the coming week(s)
                            <hr />
                            <h4>Week Five - Sunday, Feb 5 </h4>
                            This week I mainly played around with some of the things that I learned on my website.  I've learned a lot about using Jquery in the recent weeks and played around with knockout JS a little bit. 
                            (5 hours) It doesn't make sense to use Knockout JS with my project because a lot of the data binding that is done with knockout can also be used with knockout.  I created some custom bindinghandlers 
                            0and custom validation rules.  These tools will be valuable at work I am sure since we use Knockout JS on one of our website.  This week I also spent time learning how I can do similar things that 
                            I learned with knockout with angular JS. (4 hours)
